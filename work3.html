        <p>
          With over one billion users, TikTok is arguably one of the most pop-
          ular social media platforms of all time (Duffy, 2023). The app itself
          
          functions as follows: each user has an individual account/profile
          and can create videos to share with both their followers or friends,
          but those videos also can reach individuals with whom the user has
          no literal connection. Users can like, comment on, and share videos
          with others (Zhang, 2023). The “For You Page” allows users to view
          
          videos curated for them. TikTok uses a specific and unique algo-
          rithm to introduce the videos on a user’s “For You Page”— further
          
          individualizing user experiences. TikTok’s immense success has led
          to other popular platforms integrating features originally unique
          
          to TikTok; YouTube Shorts and Instagram’s Reels both closely resemble
           the user experience on TikTok. However, they arguably fall
          
          short of capturing its true essence, as they act more as secondary
          content forms to boost platform engagement than TikTok that uses
          them as a primary content form. Further, brands, influencers, and
          celebrities have utilized TikTok to promote their content. Given the
          extreme popularity and influence of the application and its relevance
          to individuals and companies looking to expand their audiences and
          increase their popularity, it is important to understand the factors

          that determine a video’s virality on the platform. This understand-
          ing can potentially provide valuable insights for content creators on

          how to optimize video details such as video descriptions to increase
          the likelihood of virality when it comes to dance trend videos on
          TikTok. The decision to analyze specifically dance trends comes
          from the platform’s popularity and market di!erentiation from other
          social media platforms due to viral dance trends started by artists
          and influencers on the platform during COVID-19 lockdowns. Since
          most were at home and had limited access to outside entertainment,
          many households found joy in watching and recreating these dances

          to the original sounds they were posted to. Now, beyond the lock-
          down, TikTok dance trends continue to go viral and are now used

          by content creators and brands (not just to entertain their audience)
          but to promote their content and businesses. Therefore, insights into
          how these trends become viral could be game-changers in the world
          of TikTok content creation, o!ering new strategies and approaches
          for maximizing the reach and impact of dance trend videos. For
          our study, we investigated the patterns that influence the virality of

          TikTok videos and how this changes over time? To answer this question, 
          we looked into two questions and hypothesized what would

          happen in the study:
          RQ1: What distinguishes the accounts driving the accelerated
          virality of trends?
          RQ2: How do specific trends in video descriptions contribute to
          the virality of TikTok videos?

<!-- 
          The results showed that most trends started from a mega/macro with a few nano influencers. There were more nano influencers who 
          posted in the beginning of the trend compared to the peak. At the peak, the author of the video with the most views tends 
          to be mega/macro influencers, and there are more mega and macro influencers in th peak.

          I managed the entire first hypothesis by scraping data from TikTok. 
          I filtered that dataset to identify the top 5 songs per year and determined the influencer’s tier based on our predefined scale.
          Additionally, I created a time series for each song, with the frequency representing the total number of view counts.

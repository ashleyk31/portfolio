            <h2>ARTIST STATEMENT</h2>
            <p>
                My sustained investigation focuses on the unique Korean culture through
                their unique colors, unique texture, and ancient tradition designs.
                After researching through multiple media, I produced a list of the most
                used unique color combinations, items, and designs that appeared
                throughout them to create a miniature figure using paper and other items
                to express the unique texture as much as possible. My focus was on the
                colors, which were also known as the Obangsaek, which means five colors
                including blue, red, yellow, white, and black. Hoping to capture the
                details of each item, I used different lightings, textures of paper,
                backgrounds, and properties to allow the viewers to fully observe the
                object and the culture. There are a total of ten photographs: the Korean
                dish (kimbap), traditional Korean letters (hangul), traditional lanterns
                along the unique roof design (Cheongsa chorong, Giwa), traditional fans,
                traditional folding screen (byeong-poong), another famous Korean dish
                (bibimbap), traditional board game (Yun nori), another traditional roof
                design (Giwa), traditional clothing (hanbok), and a modern drinking
                environment with the silver table and the kimchi side dish. I hope
                people can view this series not only to see the details in each
                photograph but also to recognize the culture and to understand that
                these are all part of the unique Korean culture that should be
                acknowledged.

          With over one billion users, TikTok is arguably one of the most popular social media platforms of all time. 
          The app itself functions as follows: each user has an individual account/profile and can create videos to 
          share with both their followers or friends, but those videos also can reach individuals with whom the user
           has no literal connection. Users can like, comment on, and share videos with others. The “For You Page” 
           allows users to view videos curated for them. TikTok uses a specific and unique algorithm to introduce the 
           videos on a user's “For You Page” – further individualizing user experiences. Tiktok’s immense success has 
           led to other popular platforms integrating features originally unique to TikTok; YouTube Shorts and Instagram’s 
           Reels both closely resemble the user experience on Tiktok, however, they arguably fall short of capturing its true 
           essence. Given the extreme popularity and influence of the application, it is important to understand the workings 
           of the recommendation system algorithm. Maximilian Boeker and Aleksandra Urman, of the University of Zurich, 
           attempted to do so in their work “An Empirical Investigation of Personalization Factors on TikTok.” In the study, 
           they used a sock-puppet audit methodology, also known as virtual agent-based auditing, to create an environment 
           that can allow the bots to mimic realistic user behavior to determine the effects of the different factors.
            We aimed to recreate parts of their work, in a project collaborating with multiple teams. While other teams 
            focused on understanding the follow and like features, our team served as the control, to assess whether the 
            language of the website could affect the content the algorithm suggests on the For You Page.

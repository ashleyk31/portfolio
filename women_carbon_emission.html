          Since the 1970's, global carbon emissions have been increasing, contributing to global warming. 
          The amount of carbon each country emits is regulated by their parliament. 
          Yet, there is hardly any research on how gender identity affects the attitudes surrounding 
          climate change which may pertain to how a country decides to handle their carbon emissions. 
          Most studies focus on other variables, but, we know men and women experience stem education 
          and other social factors differently; meaning concerns that reflect their climate change attitude may differ. 
          So our goal was to explore the possible relationship between women's representation in office and the way 
          a country handles climate issues. 
          <br><br>
          We were able to conduct statistical tests to identify the correlation between the amount of CO2 a country emits 
          and the percentage of women in their parliament.

          <p style="padding-left: 50px;">The project consisted of four members. We collaborated throughout the entire process of brainstorming, researching, and analyzing for a month. Ultimately, we presented our findings in front of the class and other professors.</p>

            I played a key role in the data cleaning process by identifying and addressing missing data. 
            This involved checking for missing values and determining the best methods to handle them. 
            Additionally, I removed duplicates to ensure data integrity. 
            Our project utilized two datasets, which I successfully merged for comprehensive analysis. 
            Furthermore, I was responsible for writing the background section of the paper and conducting the ANOVA 
            and regression analyses to obtain the final results, including the necessary p-values.

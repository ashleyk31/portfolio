        <p style="padding-left: 50px;">
          With over one billion users, TikTok is one of the most popular social media platforms of all time. 
          TikTok uses a specific and unique algorithm to introduce the videos on a user's “For You Page”, which 
          further individualizing user experiences. Given the extreme popularity and influence of the application, 
          it is important to understand the workings of the recommendation system algorithm. 
          <br><br>
          We aimed to recreate parts of the work of “An Empirical Investigation of Personalization Factors on TikTok” 
          by Maximilian Boeker and Aleksandra Urman (University of Zurich) with multiple teams. While other teams 
          focused on understanding the follow and like features, our team served as the control, to assess whether the 
          <span style="font-size: larger; text-decoration: underline;">language</span> of the website could affect 
          the content the algorithm suggests on the For You Page.
          <br><br>
          <p style="padding-left: 50px; font-size: larger;"><strong>Role : Project Manager, Data Analyst, Data Scientist</strong> </p>
          <p style="padding-left: 50px;">The project consisted of five members. We collaborated throughout the entire process of brainstorming, 
            data collecting, and data analyzing for a month. Ultimately, we presented our findings in front of the class.</p>

          <p style="padding-left: 50px;">
            For this project, our task was to scrape data from TikTok and analyze it. 
            Each team member was responsible for a different language, and I handled the German language. 
            I scraped the website 20 times per account, each time retrieving different content, while some recommendations were repeated, which is what we expected to happen. 
            Using web scraping techniques, I collected data from two TikTok accounts by extracting information about the
            recommended videos on the For You Page, including the author, time, tags, and descriptions.
            <br><br>
            Once everyone had gathered their respective data, we combined the information and performed an analysis to identify 
            the top hashtags across all six languages, which is displayed below. 
            For my part, I calculated the Jaccard Index for the German data, which resulted in an index value of 0.16. 
            Notably, the trend showed a decrease in the index over time, indicating that TikTok's algorithm tends to 
            recommend more personalized content based on a user's interactions and behavior on the platform.

          <p>
              My 5 teammates and I replicated a research from the
              University of Zurich, investigating how TikTok's recommendation
              algorithm personalizes content across different languages. We
              successfully scraped and analyzed data from six language settings,
              serving as the control group to isolate whether language alone
              influences the For You Page—revealing that TikTok's algorithm
              increasingly personalizes content over time, with Jaccard Index values
              decreasing as user sessions progress. My role as Project Manager and
              Data Analyst focused on German-language data collection,
              cross-language analysis, and similarity metrics. This case study
              emphasizes the web scraping methodology I implemented, the Jaccard
              Index calculations I performed, and the coordination strategies that
              unified our team's multilingual dataset into coherent findings.

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        With over one billion users, TikTok is one of the most popular social
        media platforms of all time. TikTok uses a specific and unique algorithm
        to introduce the videos on a user's “For You Page”, which further
        individualizing user experiences. Given the extreme popularity and
        influence of the application, it is important to understand the workings
        of the recommendation system algorithm. We aimed to recreate parts of
        the work of “An Empirical Investigation of Personalization Factors on
        TikTok” by Maximilian Boeker and Aleksandra Urman (University of Zurich)
        with multiple teams. While other teams focused on understanding the
        follow and like features, our team served as the control, to assess
        whether the language of the website could affect the content the
        algorithm suggests on the For You Page.
      </p>

      <h3>My Contribution</h3>
      <p>
        For this project, our task was to scrape data from TikTok and analyze
        it. Each team member was responsible for a different language, and I
        handled the German language. I scraped the website 20 times per account,
        each time retrieving different content, while some recommendations were
        repeated, which is what we expected to happen. Using web scraping
        techniques, I collected data from two TikTok accounts by extracting
        information about the recommended videos on the For You Page, including
        the author, time, tags, and descriptions. Once everyone had gathered
        their respective data, we combined the information and performed an
        analysis to identify the top hashtags across all six languages, which is
        displayed below. For my part, I calculated the Jaccard Index for the
        German data, which resulted in an index value of 0.16. Notably, the
        trend showed a decrease in the index over time, indicating that TikTok's
        algorithm tends to recommend more personalized content based on a user's
        interactions and behavior on the platform.

        Hi! My name is Ashley, and I am a recent graduate from Wellesley College
        currently pursuing a master’s degree at University of Michigan School of
        Information, focusing on big data analytics. I am passionate about
        cybersecurity, user research, and human-computer interaction, and I
        aspire to work as a data analyst in the healthcare field! In my free
        time, I like to travel, design postcards, and make scrapbooks.
      </p>

      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p >
        Since my first (and only) T1-84 graphing calculator, I've been obsessed
        with finding patterns in numbers. Now, I combine my data analytics
        education from Wellesley College and the University of Michigan with
        insights from my research work to transform messy datasets into
        compelling narratives. It is my goal to ensure data tells stories that
        matter, create genuinely impactful insights both on screen and in
        boardrooms, and make people say "ohhh, that makes sense!" from time to
        time.
      </p>

      <h3 >There are so many Data Analyst. Why hire me?</h3>
      <p >
        I turn data into decisions. <br><br>
        I'm a lifelong learner who's not afraid to dive into messy datasets.
        Through everything I do, I'm constantly growing as an analyst and
        overall storyteller. I'm willing to step in and tackle whatever needs
        analyzing, regardless of tools or domains. Need someone to wrangle messy
        CSV files and build dashboards? I got you. Need help running statistical
        models and presenting insights to stakeholders? I'm your person.
      </p>

      <h3 >If I wasn't an analyst, what would I be?</h3>
      <p >
        Ideally, an origami artist teaching people that one crease at a time
        creates something beautiful. <br><br>
        Realistically, a film critic breaking down the narrative choices that
        make us laugh, cry, or think differently. Above anything, I love
        storytelling and understanding human behavior, what resonates with
        audiences, and how paying attention to the details reveals the bigger picture, 
        something like folding paper or analyzing data :&#41;

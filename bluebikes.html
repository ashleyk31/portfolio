          <p>
            I analyzed 2020–2024 Bluebikes ridership data to uncover the factors
            driving station popularity across Metro Boston. This project
            successfully integrated spatial, demographic, and environmental
            datasets to build a predictive model with interaction
            effects, demonstrating that geographic placement near urban centers is
            the strongest predictor of usage. My role spanned the full analytical
            pipeline: data cleaning, exploratory analysis, model selection using
            AIC/BIC criteria, and assumption validation. This case study
            highlights the statistical methods and visualization techniques I
            employed to deliver clear, data-backed recommendations.

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            Bluebikes is a public transportation system in the Metro Boston area
            with over 4,500 bikes distributed across more than 480 stations. This
            research investigates how station characteristics and demographic
            factors contribute to usage patterns, with a focus on the popularity of
            Bluebike stations in Massachusetts during the summer months. The
            Bluebike datasets from 2020–2024 were cleaned, analyzed, and visualized
            as part of this project.
        </p>
        <h3>Description of Additional Datasets</h3>
        <p>
            There were several additional datasets that I included in this project
            besides the original Bluebikes dataset, which was required for this
            analysis. One of the additions is the institution dataset, which
            contains information about institutions, including their names,
            latitudes, and longitudes. I included this dataset with the hypothesis
            that the number of institutions within a certain distance from a station
            might influence that station’s popularity compared to stations that are
            not near an institution. Another dataset I included was the
            MBTA_NODE.shp dataset, a spatial dataset of the MBTA (Massachusetts Bay
            Transportation Authority) subway stations in the Greater Boston Area. It
            includes details such as station name, latitude, longitude, line, and
            route. Similar to the institution hypothesis, I hypothesized that the
            presence of a nearby MBTA station might affect a Bluebikes station’s
            popularity. The last additional dataset I included was the weather
            dataset, which contains values such as precipitation, humidity, daily
            high and low temperatures, and snow depth. This dataset was added to
            explore whether station popularity shows patterns related to specific
            weather conditions on a given day.
        </p>
        <h3>Key Highlights</h3>
        <p>~8,800 observations × 28 variables</p>
        
        <h4>Dataset</h4>
        <p>
            Bluebike trips (2020–2024 summer months), station data, MBTA data,
            institution data, and weather data
        </p>
        <h4>Methods</h4>
        <p>
            Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, modeling with AIC/BIC model
            selection, visualization
        </p>
        

        <h3>Methodology</h3>
        <p>
            I started the analyses by checking for multicollinearity, which led to
            the removal of the population variable due to its high VIF score of 53.
            Next, multiple first-order models were compared using several metrics,
            including the 10-fold cross-validation. While the non-interactive models
            showed little variation across metrics, the AIC model with interaction
            terms performed slightly better, yielding the lowest RMSE, highest R²,
            and lowest MAE. Outliers were identified using the threshold of 4/n and
            subsequently removed. The best-performing model, the AIC interaction
            model with outliers removed, was then checked for assumptions. After
            applying a Box-Cox transformation, the residual spread became more
            stable, with clusters reflecting a higher concentration of data points
            from Boston, Cambridge, and Somerville. Despite this clustering, the
            residuals were evenly distributed around the zero line across fitted
            values, which satisfied the constant variance assumption. Finally, a
            partial F-test was conducted to compare the nested AIC interaction model
            with the first-order BIC model to evaluate the necessity of interaction
            terms. The test yielded a partial F-statistic of 41.0832 with a p-value
            of 0, confirming the significance of the interaction effects.
        </p>
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>
            Based on the observations, the interactive model was identified as the
            best model for predicting the popularity of Bluebike stations. The
            results table highlights only the most significant predictors. Notably,
            both longitude and latitude were found to have positive coefficients,
            indicating that station location plays a major role in driving usage.
            These findings suggest that geographic placement, particularly proximity
            to dense urban centers like Boston, Cambridge, and Somerville, has a
            strong influence on station popularity.

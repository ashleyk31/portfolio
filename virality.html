            <p>
            I served as Data Analyst for a collaborative study examining what makes
            TikTok videos go viral, addressing critical questions for influencers,
            brands, and content creators seeking to maximize reach. Our team
            successfully analyzed dance trend data across years, combining
            influencer tier analysis with description pattern recognition—uncovering
            that specific account types and trending keywords significantly impact
            viral acceleration. My contributions addressed Research Question 1: I
            scraped TikTok data, filtered datasets to identify top 5 songs annually,
            categorized influencers using our tier framework, and developed time
            series visualizations showing view count trajectories over time. This
            case study emphasizes the data collection strategies I implemented, the
            classification systems I applied, and the temporal insights I extracted
            from viral content patterns.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            With over one billion users, TikTok functions as the following: each
            user has an individual account/profile and can create videos to share
            with both their followers or friends, but those videos also can reach
            individuals with whom the user has no literal connection. Further,
            brands, influencers, and celebrities have utilized TikTok to promote
            their content. And given the extreme popularity and influence of the
            application and its relevance to individuals and companies looking to
            expand their audiences and increase their popularity, it is important to
            understand the factors that determine a video’s virality on the
            platform. So we aimed to investigate the patterns that influence the
            virality of TikTok videos and how this changes over time. <br />
            To answer this question, we looked into two questions and hypothesized
            what would happen in the study: Research Question 1: What distinguishes
            the accounts driving the accelerated virality of trends? Research
            Question 2: How do specific trends in video descriptions contribute to
            the virality of TikTok videos? Role : Data Analyst, Data Scientist The
            project consisted of six members. We collaborated throughout the entire
            process of brainstorming, data collecting, and data analyzing for a
            month. Ultimately, we presented our findings in front of the class.

        <h2>My Contributions</h2>
        <p>
            I was responsible for conducting the first hypothesis, starting with
            scraping data from TikTok. I filtered the dataset to identify the top 5
            songs for each year and categorized the influencers based on our
            predefined tier scale. Additionally, I created a time series for each
            song, with the frequency representing the total view count over time.

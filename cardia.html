        <p style="padding-left: 50px;">
          This experiment is based on an observational dataset from the Karolinska Institute of 
          people who were diagnosed with cardia cancer in Sweden. We want to assess whether patients 
          who received medical treatment from hospitals with high-volume of patients with cardia cancer 
          have different survival rates than patients who received medical treatment from low-volume hospitals.  
          This was an individual final project. 
        </p>
        <br><br> 
        <div class = "titlestyle">Assumptions</div>
        <br><br>
        <p style="padding-left: 50px;">
          To conduct this experiment to determine if there’s a causal effect, 
          we need to check if certain criteria are met. 

          The first criteria is the SUTVA 1 and 2, and by looking at the dataset, both holds. 
          SUTVA 1 holds because the treatment of whether the patients were diagnosed at a high- 
          or low-volume hospital is clearly defined by a binary variable, where 1 is a high-volume and 0 is a low-volume hospital. 
          SUTVA 2 also seems to hold because whether a patient gets diagnosed at a high- or low-volume hospital does not affect 
          another patient’s potential outcome of the number of years of surviving after diagnosis. 
          Although some might be concerned about SUTVA 2 because there are limited hospitals and doctors in Sweden, 
          we are only looking at 158 patients, and the example above is a rare case, 
          so I think it’s ok to assume that doctors will try their best to diagnose and treat the patient as accurately as possible. 
          <br><br>
          We can assume that both SUTVA 1 and 2 hold.  
          <br><br>
          We also need to check if we can assume unconfoundedness. 
          Here, the diagnosing hospital is unconfounded, while the treating hospital is confounded. 
          If we thought that the treating hospital was unconfounded, then we could have simply done an observational study on treating hospital, 
          without the instrumental variables step. But since it is confounded, we will go through the following steps. 
        </p>

        <div class = "titlestyle">Balance Covariates</div>
        <br><br>
        <p style="padding-left: 50px;">
          After cleaning some variables, I tried two methods: 1. estimating propensity scores for each unit in the study 
          using the fitted values from a regression tree on the FromRuralArea and Male variables and 2. on all variables. 
          This tree below has a large difference between the active and control for the age variable, 
          specifically for the propensity scores 0.279 and 0.571. <br>
          <img src="art/work4-1.png" alt="propensity score 1" style="width: 70%;">
          <br><br>
          So, I created another tree using all variables (where R selected the 2 most significant covariates, 
          which are FromRuralArea and AgeAtDiagnosis), and the covariates were better balanced. 
          <br>
          <img src="art/work4-2.png" alt="propensity score 2" style="width: 70%;"><br><br>
          The mean values of active and control within the subgroups are balanced, so I used these three subclasses to estimate the average causal effect. 
        </p>
        <br><br>

        <div class = "titlestyle">Calculate the Average Causal Effect Estimate</div>
        <br><br>
        <p style="padding-left: 50px;">
          To estimate the average causal effect, I first calculated p_c and the estimated ITT to calculate the ITT_c for each of the three subgroups
          and compared the p_a values in the end. 
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <div class = "titlestyle">Results</div>
        <br><br>
        <p style="padding-left: 50px;">
          For the first subgroup (propensity score = 0.238), the estimated ITT value is 0.075 with p_c equal to 0.75, 
          leading to an ITT_c of 0.1. <br>
          For the second group (propensity score = 0.475), the estimated ITT value is 0.0627 with p_c equal to 0.524, 
          leading to an ITT_c of 0.1196. <br>
          For the third group (propensity score = 0.658), the estimated ITT value is 0.023 with p_c equal to 0.383, 
          leading to an ITT_c of 0.06. 
          <br><br>
          So, by weighing these subclasses, overall, the point estimate is 0.04200808 with the interval (-0.29, 0.2). 
          This result means that the effect of being assigned to get treated at a high-volume hospital is 0.04, with a 
          95% possibility of this effect ranging as low as -0.29 and as high as 0.2. The overall years of survival after 
          getting diagnosed would improve by 0.28 if patients with cardia cancer were treated at high-volume hospitals. 
          This is the effect that the doctors would be interested in because they can control whether they open a spot 
          in the hospital to treat a cardia cancer patient.   
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <div class = "titlestyle">Limitations</div>
        <br><br>
        <p style="padding-left: 50px;">
          The limitation of this experiment is the lack of information and details on the patients. 
          Specifically, for the YearsSurvivingAfterDiagnosis variable, are we assuming that everyone is getting the treatment? 
          When are they getting treated? If we know they survived for a year after being diagnosed, are we assuming all 
          patients were treated within a year? Why would we be counting the number of years of surviving after getting 
          diagnosed and not after getting treated if we want to see the effect of getting treated at a high-volume hospital 
          versus a low-volume hospital? Some clarifications would be needed, and there were multiple assumptions made throughout. 
          So, making sure that those are safe assumptions to make would be essential to make this result and interpretation 
          more accurate.

          <p>
              I analyzed observational data from the Karolinska Institute to
              investigate whether cardia cancer patients treated at high-volume
              hospitals have better survival outcomes than those at low-volume
              facilities. I successfully employed instrumental variables and
              propensity score methods to address confounding factors, revealing a
              modest positive effect of 0.04 years in survival when assigned to
              high-volume hospitals. My role as the analyst was to focus on
              assumption validation, propensity score modeling, and average causal
              effect estimation. This case study emphasizes the methodological rigor
              I applied (from SUTVA verification to subclass stratification) to
              extract causal insights from observational healthcare data.

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        This experiment is based on an observational dataset from the Karolinska
        Institute of people who were diagnosed with cardia cancer in Sweden. We
        want to assess whether patients who received medical treatment from
        hospitals with high-volume of patients with cardia cancer have different
        survival rates than patients who received medical treatment from
        low-volume hospitals. This was an individual final project.
      </p>

      <h3>Assumptions</h3>
      <p>
        To conduct this experiment to determine if there’s a causal effect, we
        need to check if certain criteria are met. The first criteria is the
        SUTVA 1 and 2, and by looking at the dataset, both holds. SUTVA 1 holds
        because the treatment of whether the patients were diagnosed at a high-
        or low-volume hospital is clearly defined by a binary variable, where 1
        is a high-volume and 0 is a low-volume hospital. SUTVA 2 also seems to
        hold because whether a patient gets diagnosed at a high- or low-volume
        hospital does not affect another patient’s potential outcome of the
        number of years of surviving after diagnosis. Although some might be
        concerned about SUTVA 2 because there are limited hospitals and doctors
        in Sweden, we are only looking at 158 patients, and the example above is
        a rare case, so I think it’s ok to assume that doctors will try their
        best to diagnose and treat the patient as accurately as possible. We can
        assume that both SUTVA 1 and 2 hold. We also need to check if we can
        assume unconfoundedness. Here, the diagnosing hospital is unconfounded,
        while the treating hospital is confounded. If we thought that the
        treating hospital was unconfounded, then we could have simply done an
        observational study on treating hospital, without the instrumental
        variables step. But since it is confounded, we will go through the
        following steps.
      </p>
      <h3>Balance Covariates</h3>
      <p>
        After cleaning some variables, I tried two methods: 1. estimating
        propensity scores for each unit in the study using the fitted values
        from a regression tree on the FromRuralArea and Male variables and 2. on
        all variables. This tree below has a large difference between the active
        and control for the age variable, specifically for the propensity scores
        0.279 and 0.571.
        <div class="work-images">
          <img src="art/work4-1.png" alt="propensity score 1">
        </div>
        So, I created another tree using all variables (where R selected the 2
        most significant covariates, which are FromRuralArea and
        AgeAtDiagnosis), and the covariates were better balanced.
        <div class="work-images">
          <img src="art/work4-2.png" alt="propensity score 2" />
        </div>
        The mean values of active and control within the subgroups are balanced,
        so I used these three subclasses to estimate the average causal effect.
      </p>
      <h4>Calculate the Average Causal Effect Estimate</h4>
      <p>
        To estimate the average causal effect, I first calculated p_c and the
        estimated ITT to calculate the ITT_c for each of the three subgroups and
        compared the p_a values in the end.
      </p>
      <h4>Results</h4>
      <p>
        For the first subgroup (propensity score = 0.238), the estimated ITT
        value is 0.075 with p_c equal to 0.75, leading to an ITT_c of 0.1. For
        the second group (propensity score = 0.475), the estimated ITT value is
        0.0627 with p_c equal to 0.524, leading to an ITT_c of 0.1196. For the
        third group (propensity score = 0.658), the estimated ITT value is 0.023
        with p_c equal to 0.383, leading to an ITT_c of 0.06. So, by weighing
        these subclasses, overall, the point estimate is 0.04200808 with the
        interval (-0.29, 0.2). This result means that the effect of being
        assigned to get treated at a high-volume hospital is 0.04, with a 95%
        possibility of this effect ranging as low as -0.29 and as high as 0.2.
        The overall years of survival after getting diagnosed would improve by
        0.28 if patients with cardia cancer were treated at high-volume
        hospitals. This is the effect that the doctors would be interested in
        because they can control whether they open a spot in the hospital to
        treat a cardia cancer patient.
      </p>

      <h3>Limitations</h3>
      <p>
        The limitation of this experiment is the lack of information and details
        on the patients. Specifically, for the YearsSurvivingAfterDiagnosis
        variable, are we assuming that everyone is getting the treatment? When
        are they getting treated? If we know they survived for a year after
        being diagnosed, are we assuming all patients were treated within a
        year? Why would we be counting the number of years of surviving after
        getting diagnosed and not after getting treated if we want to see the
        effect of getting treated at a high-volume hospital versus a low-volume
        hospital? Some clarifications would be needed, and there were multiple
        assumptions made throughout. So, making sure that those are safe
        assumptions to make would be essential to make this result and
        interpretation more accurate.
